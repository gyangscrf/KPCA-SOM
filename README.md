# KPCA-SOM
Obtain the rank for different spatial realizations (e.g. permeability field or facies)

Looked at and run KPCASOM_test.m first to see the output of the script,
then you could load your own data to call KPCASOM_rank.m. Note that each column in the model ensembles represent one realization
